We are a small (19 horse maximum) family-friendly yard located at Newton Farm, just outside Wormit village, Fife.

Full, half or assisted livery spaces are available now at competitive rates in our yard . In addition to stabling, office and individual tack storage areas we offer the use of a floodlit "all-weather" school with a variety of show jumps.

Individual or group lessons are offered from our BHS qualified instructor for owners of horses in the yard.

A selection of safe, off-road hacking routes are directly accessible from the stable block.
